Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.

Even within the famed and battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi was a genius of such talent, never before seen in the history of the academy.[55] Well-known for consistently showing prowess far beyond his years, he quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the strongest shinobi Konoha ever produced. Danzo, in the presence of Hiruzen claimed that Itachi is the sort of ninja you see maybe once every hundred years. [56] Itachi had the fastest time for completing the Forest of Death in his Chūnin Exams, in 5 hours and 37 minutes, while 9 years old and competing solo.[16] Despite his still young age, he was highly proficient in all three main ninja skill sets, effortlessly learning new techniques from simple observation, and gained praise from allies and foes alike; Orochimaru, one of the Sannin, openly admitted Itachi was stronger than him,[57] and Shisui, well-regarded as the strongest Uchiha of their time, viewed Itachi as stronger.[58] Despite being weakened from illness, while Sasuke had trained under and absorbed Orochimaru's power, Itachi could have killed Sasuke during their final battle if he wanted to.[59] After Itachi's Death, Obito, the leader of the Akatsuki, openly claimed that Itachi was the only one standing in Akatsuki's way. [60]Even when restraining himself, Itachi still pushed a 3-man team of elite jōnin to their limits.[23] Kabuto, who had created the likes of Edo Nagato and Edo Madara, considered Edo Itachi as his finest foil.
